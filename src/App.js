      <p>Our dear Stewart passed away unexpectedly Thursday, June 27, 2019 at the age of 33.</p>

<p>Reflecting the thoughtful and heartfelt spirit in which Stewart shared his many stories,
  we will be holding a memorial service where participants can reflect, and choose to share
  something from the heart.  You are free to prepare something to share (thoughts, feelings,
  a poem, some music, or other), or do something impromptu as you feel led.</p>

<p>You can consider whether you want to go up to the podium and be recorded or share audio only
at a microphone from your seat.  You will also have the option of having your name and
relationship to Stewart displayed on screen to the participants.</p>

<p>In honor of Stewart’s career, we will be live streaming the memorial service, and recording
and publishing it for the future. The live stream, recording and other contributions in
Stewart’s memory will be available from <a href="https://mydnight.net/">mydnight.net</a>.</p>
